## My process

### Built with

-HTML,CSS and JS
-Flexbox
-CSS Grid

### What I learned
I learnt that using svg icon code directly in the HTML markup is the easiest way to change the properties of the svg icon based on user events (eg: hover,active etc.. pesudo selectors)

### Useful resources
- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS)
- [Example resource 3](https://css-tricks.com/change-color-of-svg-on-hover/)

The first two links are enough for reading documentation on different CSS properties and concepts

## Acknowledgments

Before Writing any code try to first think about how to write the markup by dividing the design in to different components.This will save you a lot of time.
